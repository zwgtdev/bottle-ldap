bottleLdap is a plugin to allow lovers of Bottle to embrace LDAP.

It was inspired by https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/bottle-cork, a brilliant
module that I was making use of for many years until I had organisational 
requirements to begin making use of LDAP integration for user authentication.

There is a wee example to help you get started, if you find yourself stuck or
have suggestions, please send me a mail or better yet, send a pull request :-)

Hope that you find this useful.
